# Configuration
The first thing I did was implement Model View Controller and then use front controller, in addition, friendly routes were implemented using modules such as mod_rewrite from htaccess with your settings making it go to config/parameters.php
`define("BASE_URL","http://localhost/phpmvc/"); `, also, the implementation of to show the progress bar was done through javascript.
